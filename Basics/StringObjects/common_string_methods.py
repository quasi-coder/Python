#so if I use like a German sharp S here, and we run this, you notice that comes out to a lowercase ss. Where if I just do #this in lower, and run it, you notice it does not lowercase the German sharp S. And so that's useful for words like #strasse, the name of a street in German. And if I make that casefold, then it spells it in lowercase.

# Strings are immutable, any operation on them creates new object

# Literal strings can be concatenated like this
s5 = 'this string ' ' that string'
